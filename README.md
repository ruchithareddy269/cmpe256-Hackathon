## CMPE256-Hackathon Project
## Harnessing Language Models for Insightful Macroeconomic Analysis from User-Driven Prompts
 This is the README for the CMPE256 hackathon project. This entry is for the Geek Squad team, which consists of the following team members:
 1. Ruchitha Reddy Koluguri
 2. Suresh Ravuri
 3. Harshavardhan Raghavendra Valmiki

## FIRST APPROACH:
## Project Description
The goal of this hackathon is to create a model that can evaluate and address inquiries about Indian Budget Speeches from 1947 to 2021. The project utilizes large language models (LLM) and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze government and economic data files.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop an advanced AI tool using ChatGPT and other OpenAI models, along with LangChain, to interpret and respond to user queries. This tool aims to analyze user inputs, search through provided PDF documents, and deliver accurate, context-relevant answers by employing advanced natural language processing and information retrieval algorithms. The focus is on balancing efficiency in data handling and precision in response generation, ensuring the system effectively and accurately meets user query needs.
## Project Deliverables
Please find the below list of deliverables related to this project.

1. CMPE-256-Hackathon_2023.docx : This document contains the detailed explanation of the project along with the output screenshots.
   
2. input_output_log.txt : Prompts and Responses are stored automatically in a text file when the user enters a prompt.

3. README.md: README file contains project details.

4. GeekSquad_Hackathon_cmpe256.ipynb: The code for this project is in a Google Colab Python notebook.

## SECOND APPROACH:

CMPE 256_Hackathon_with_chatgpt_UI.docx :With the help of ChatGPT, we developed a bot named Finance Minister. We fed it all the PDf and CSV files, and it reacts to user commands by retrieving the data from the supplied files.
